#logical conditions from mathematics:
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
#An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

"""
Example:
If statement:

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
"""

"""
How If Statements Work
The if statement evaluates a condition (an expression that results in True or False). If the condition is true, the code block inside the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

Example:
Checking if a number is positive:

number = 15
if number > 0:
  print("The number is positive")
"""

#Python can evaluate many types of values as True or False in an if statement
"""
Example:
Using a boolean variable:

is_logged_in = True
if is_logged_in:
  print("Welcome back!")
