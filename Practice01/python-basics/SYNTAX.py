"""
Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

C:\Users\Your Name>py myfile.py
"""

"""
Python identation - is a space at the beginning of a code line. It is very important in Python.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. for example:
"""
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

"""
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

Example (Syntax Error):
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
"""
#The number of spaces is up to a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

#Comments
#Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
#Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment

"""
Exercise:
1) Identation in python is for readability only: False
2) if 5 > 2:
      print("YES")
