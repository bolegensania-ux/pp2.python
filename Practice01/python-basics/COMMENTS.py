            Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a "#", and Python will ignore them.

#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments. To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
#This is a comment
#written in

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
